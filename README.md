# odin-recipes
In this project, i will show my skills in basics of web development using HTML to build a website for my favorite recipes.

This includes a homepage (i.e. index.html) and all recipes are linked in the homepage.

All of recipes have title, image, description, ingredients, and steps to cook them.
