    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Ash reshteh is a wonderful soup that's traditionally made with Persian noodles called "reshteh". You can find them in Middle Eastern stores or use linguine pasta as a substitute. This hearty spiced soup topped with yogurt and fried red onions is a Persian New Year tradition.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>⅓ cup dry chickpeas (garbanzo beans)</li>

        <li>⅓ cup dry kidney beans</li>

        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil, divided, or as needed</li>

        <li>1 large red onion, thinly sliced</li>

        <li>1 tablespoon dried mint</li> 

        <li>2 large yellow onions, thinly sliced</li> 

        <li>6 cloves garlic, or to taste, minced</li> 

        <li>2 teaspoons ground turmeric</li> 

        <li>6 cups vegetable stock</li> 

        <li>3 bunches scallions, chopped (green parts only)</li> 

        <li>3 cups packed chopped fresh parsley</li>

        <li>2 cups packed chopped fresh cilantro</li> 

        <li>2 cups packed chopped fresh mint</li> 

        <li>½ cup dry lentils</li> 

        <li>½ pound linguine pasta</li> 

        <li>1 pound fresh spinach, chopped</li> 

        <li>1 tablespoon all-purpose flour</li> 

        <li>salt and fresh ground pepper to taste</li> 

        <li>1 cup Greek yogurt</li> 

    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place chickpeas and kidney beans into a large container; cover with several inches of cool water. Let stand 8 hours to overnight; drain.</li>
        <li>Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add red onion; cook and stir until onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to low; continue cooking and stirring until onion is tender and golden brown, about 40 minutes more. Stir in dried mint; cook until onions become dark brown and crisp, about 15 minutes. Set aside for garnish.</li>
        <li>Heat remaining olive oil in a stock pot; stir in yellow onions. Cook and stir until onion has turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and stir until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in chickpeas, kidney beans, and turmeric; toss to combine. Stir in vegetable stock; simmer soup for 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Stir scallions, parsley, cilantro, mint, and lentils into soup; simmer 30 minutes more. Break linguine into 3 sections, stir into soup, and cook at a low boil until noodles are soft, 8 to 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir 1/2 of the spinach into the soup until wilted, about 1 minute. Stir in remaining spinach and simmer for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
        <li>Stir flour with 3 tablespoons of the soup liquid together in a small bowl until smooth. Stir flour mixture back into soup. Continue to simmer soup over low heat, stirring frequently, until thickened, about 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Serve soup with yogurt and fried red onions.</li>
    </ol>
